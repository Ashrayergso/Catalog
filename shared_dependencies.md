Shared Dependencies:

1. **Package.json**: This file will contain the dependencies for the Next.js application, including Next.js itself, TypeScript, and any other necessary libraries for server-side rendering, routing, and exporting to Excel.

2. **tsconfig.json**: This file will contain the configuration for TypeScript, which will be used across all TypeScript files (.tsx) in the project.

3. **Equipment Schema**: The equipment data schema will be shared across multiple components. This schema will include fields for name, details, cost, description, manufacturer number, model, type, image of the item, and link to product.

4. **DOM Element IDs**: The JavaScript functions will interact with DOM elements such as the equipment list, individual equipment items, and the export, search, and quantity input buttons. These elements will need unique IDs that are shared across the relevant files.

5. **Function Names**: Functions for exporting to Excel, searching online, and searching for alternatives will be shared across multiple files. These functions will likely be defined in the utils files and imported into the component files where they are used.

6. **CSS Modules**: The CSS modules in the styles directory will be shared across the component files that require them. Each component will import its corresponding CSS module for styling.

7. **Message Names**: Any messages that are displayed to the user, such as errors or confirmations, will need to be consistent across the application. These message names will be shared across multiple files.

8. **Requirements.txt, readme.txt, instructions.txt**: These files will contain information about the project and its dependencies, instructions for use, and any other necessary documentation. They will be shared with anyone who uses or contributes to the project.
